# AdGear-Client-Final-Year-Project
There are two apps one is for client (aka bill board) and one is advertisers. Client will send its login credentials and get the videos along with its Geo points. Client app will compare geo points to its current location and plays the video. The advertiser can create accounts for client and add video as well as geopoints through geo fencing.
